# JOB BOARD


This repository holds the codebase for a technical HTML/CSS/JS exercise.

### Requirements

To build the project, you will need:

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  - [NPM](https://npmjs.org) / a package manager
  - [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) / a CSS pre-processor
  - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) / a streaming build system for JavaScript


### Installation

Install *Gulp* globally by typing the following command:

```bash
(sudo) npm install -g gulp
```

Download the project dependencies from NPM using `npm install`.


### Build system

With *Gulp* you can develop right away by typing `gulp` on a terminal, in the root directory of the project. It will compile the assets, watch for changes in the .scss and .js files.

To build and optimize the assets for deployment, use `gulp build`.
